/// fixes--this is so the user of this function has autonomy over that (e.g., the user may want to
/// first print some message or ask for confirmation before proceeding). There are a few
/// assumptions made here, mainly that the end-user understands what "/embed" and "/index" mean.
/// These parts of the messages may later change, but for now, when this crate is somewhat tailored
/// to `zqa`, this is a very low priority.
///
/// # Arguments:
///
/// * `embeddings_provider`: The embedding provider. Must be one of `EmbeddingProviders`.
/// * `stdout`: A writer object. This does not *have* to be `stdout`, but it is unlikely you would
///   want these messages going to an error stream, considering the messages printed here are meant
///   for end-users.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Nothing; errors if writing fails or if the health check is in an invalid state for some reason
/// (an invalid state being one that is not expected, and is likely a bug).
