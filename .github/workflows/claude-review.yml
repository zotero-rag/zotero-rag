            Please review this pull request with a focus on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues. Use the AGENTS.md file for guidance. In particular, the following guidelines are important:

            * Minimize the use of emojis unless you need to strongly emphasize something; use standard Markdown instead.
            * Do not leave inline comments unless you have specific recommendations for improvements.
            * Do not leave inline comments to state that something has improved or is better than before.
            * Keep your overall comment concise. In a paragraph or two, describe the overall PR quality and the recommendations in your comments.
            * If an inline comment you leave is pedantic or otherwise minor, prefix it with "nit: ", and keep it short, about one sentence. This is not to discourage nitpicky or pedantic comments, however.
            * When reviewing a revision of a PR, you should check not only whether the previous comments were addressed, but also whether the changed code itself follows the style guides, introduces new bugs, has inefficiencies, etc.
