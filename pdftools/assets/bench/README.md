# Benchmark files

Below are the files used for these benchmarks. Filenames correspond to the number of pages in that paper. These papers were chosen randomly as a subset of my Zotero library with varying lengths. Some, such as the first, are very simple (mostly text, one image), while others, such as `49.pdf`, are very math-heavy.
